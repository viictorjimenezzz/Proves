# Proves
 Basic Lightning-Hydra experimental setup implementation.

- Two primary configuration files available: `train_CV` (for CV models) and `train_NLP` (for NLP models).
- The file `train.py` has to be manually modified to select a primary configuration (line 80).
- Data sources `caltech101` and `AGnews` are not available due to their size.
